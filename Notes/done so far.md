Instructors for the course: Hadelin de Ponteves and Kirill Eremenko


# Section 1: Welcome to the course
>> downloaded `FAQ pdf` file and `whole code folder`
>> downloaded and installed Anaconda 4.2 (as they said, not latest one)
>> downloaded and installed R and RStudio (latest, free version)
>> part 11: Meet your instructors: there's a 49m long podcast


# Section 2: -------- Part 1: Data Preprocessing --------
>> created account on https://www.superdatascince.com with pass: `DataScience`
>> downloaded the template folder and sample datasets for this section
>> learnt how to import libs
>> learnt how to import datasets
>> learnt how to fill missing data in python and R (by taking average)
>> learnt how to handle categorical data (cols having text based values, converted into binary numbers in special way)
>> learnt how to split dataset into training set and test set
>> learnt feature scaling
>> cleared up data preprocessing template


# Section 3: -------- Part 2: Regression --------


# Section 4: Simple Linear Regression
>> downloaded sample dataset to assigned folder
>> implemented same data-preprocessing algo in this case, took 1/3 of data as test set
>> simple linear regression in python, R


# Section 5: Multiple Linear Regression
>> imported dataset, 50_Startups.csv
>> performed preprocessing: encoding categorical data, splitting into training and test set
>> fitting mlr to training set, predicting y for X_test
>> performing backward elimination, removing var with max value of `p` until largest value of p is less than 5%


# Section 6: Polynomial Regression
>> downloaded dataset to designated folder
>> performed pre-procession algo from same template
>> skipped splitting of dataset
>> regressor `poly_reg` tested with diff degree values
>> compared polynomial regression to simple linear regression
>> used these model to predict values

>> created template for future non-linear regression models


# Section 7: Support Vector Regression (SVR)
>> downloaded dataset to designated folder
>> copied code from template mde earlier
>> created a regressor for SVR in python
>> un-commented feature scaling
>> implemented and saw the result
>> did same thing in R, except, feature scaling was still commented


# Section 8: Decision Tree Regression
